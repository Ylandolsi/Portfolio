  //       <p className="mb-6">
  //         I'm a software engineer who thrives on solving complex problems through elegant code.
  //         My journey began with a Computer Science degree from Stanford University, and I've since
  //         worked with startups and Fortune 500 companies to deliver high-impact solutions.
  //       </p>
  //       <p className="mb-6">
  //         I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and fostering collaborative environments
  //         where teams can do their best work. When I'm not coding, you'll find me contributing to
  //         open source projects, mentoring junior developers, or exploring the latest in AI and machine learning.
  //       </p>
  //       <p>
  //         Let's connect and build something amazing together! Whether you're looking for a
  //         developer to join your team, need help with a project, or just want to chat about tech,
  //       </p>
